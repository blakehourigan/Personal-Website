                            I am planning to begin work on my next project in the coming weeks. This project will be a terminal implementation of space invaders. It will build off of the foundation I have created with my <b>
                                JBVim </b> project which manipulated the terminal manually using terminal escape codes. It will further teach me about manipulation of the terminal, building libraries useful for more than a 
                            single project, representation of important data and more. This page will be updated with further information as the project draws to a close
